# Easy Discord Bot Hosting - Step by Step

## Option 1: Replit Deployment (Fastest - You're Already Here!)

### Steps:
1. **In your current Replit project:**
   - Look for the "Deploy" button (usually top-right or in sidebar)
   - Click "Deploy"

2. **Choose deployment type:**
   - Select "Autoscale Deployment"
   - This keeps your bot running 24/7

3. **Configure deployment:**
   - It will use your existing code
   - Make sure `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is in your Secrets tab
   - Click "Deploy"

4. **Your bot will be live in 2-3 minutes**

### Pros:
- No setup needed - you're already here
- Uses your existing code and secrets
- Reliable Replit infrastructure

## Option 2: Cyclic.sh (Completely Free Alternative)

### Steps:
1. **Go to cyclic.sh**
2. **Click "Connect GitHub"**
3. **Create GitHub repo first:**
   - Go to github.com
   - Create new repository
   - Upload your bot files (drag and drop)

4. **Back to Cyclic:**
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variable: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token`
   - Click Deploy

### Time: 5-10 minutes total

## Option 3: Glitch.com (Super Beginner Friendly)

### Steps:
1. **Go to glitch.com**
2. **Click "New Project" → "Import from GitHub"**
3. **If no GitHub repo, use "hello-node" template:**
   - Delete existing files
   - Upload your bot files
   - Create `.env` file with: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token`

4. **Edit package.json if needed**
5. **Click "Show" → "In a New Window" to start bot**

## Option 4: DigitalOcean (Professional with Free Credits)

### Steps:
1. **Sign up at digitalocean.com** (get $200 free credit)
2. **Go to "Apps" section**
3. **Create App from GitHub**
4. **Configure:**
   - Select repository
   - Add environment variable for bot token
   - Deploy

## Quick Recommendation:

**Try Replit Deployment first** since you're already here:
1. Click "Deploy" button in your project
2. Choose "Autoscale"
3. Deploy with existing secrets
4. Done in 2 minutes

If that doesn't work, **Cyclic.sh is the easiest external option** - just needs you to upload your code to GitHub first.
